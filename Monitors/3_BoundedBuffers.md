## Bounded Buffers Exercise: Monitors

Implement a monitor named monitorBounder_Buffer in AWAIT that manages a circular buffer with a maximum capacity of n elements. 

This monitor should allow:
- Adding an element to the buffer if space is available.
- Removing an element from the buffer if data is available.
Use conditional variables to synchronize operations and ensure processes wait when the buffer is either full or empty, as needed.
