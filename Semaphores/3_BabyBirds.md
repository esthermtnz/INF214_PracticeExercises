## Baby Birds Exercise: Semaphores

Consider the following [somewhat biologically inaccurate] problem (illustrated in Fig. 1):

We have N baby birds and one parent bird.
The baby birds eat out of a common dish that initially contains F portions of food.
Each baby repeatedly

eats one portion of food at a time,
sleeps for a while, and then
comes back to eat.


When the dish becomes empty, the baby bird who empties the dish awakens the parent bird.

The parent refills the dish with F portions, then
waits for the dish to become empty again.


This pattern repeats forever.

Represent the birds as processes and develop pseudo-code in the Await Language that simulates their actions. Use semaphores for synchronization.
