## Task about semaphores for practicing when preparing for the exam ðŸ›‚

There exits an intersection where two main roads Road A and Road B, intersect. To manage traffic at this intersection, the city has installed a traffic light system. However, due to the complexity and the high volume of traffic, special rules have been established to ensure a smooth and fair flow of vehicles.

-Vehicles arriving on Road A or Road B can queue up at the intersection and wait for the green light.

-The traffic light system alternates between allowing vehicles from Road A and Road B to pass.

-A group of vehicles from one road (say, Road A) can only proceed when the light for Road A is green, and during that time, no vehicles from Road B are allowed to enter the intersection, and vice versa.

-To prevent any one road from monopolizing the intersection, after a set number of vehicles from Road A (say, 5 vehicles), the light will automatically switch to allow vehicles from Road B, even if there are more vehicles waiting on Road A. Similarly, after a set number of vehicles from Road B pass, the light will switch to allow vehicles from Road A.
